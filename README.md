# NikonDSLRRenamer
This program renames all files imported from NIkon DSLR camera having filename as "DSC_XXXX.[NEF|MOV|JPG|jpg]" into unique files that won't conflict already present files in the directory by renaming it to NIK[DATE]_[24HRTime]_XXXX.[ext]

In future releases, there will be an option to rename the files with a prefix such as [NIK][Prefix][Date]_[24HrTime]_XXXX.[ext]
